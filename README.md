# predator-prey
A predator &amp; prey simulation written in Rust.

This is still HIGHLY experimental.

To run:
- Ensure you have the rust toolchain installed (rustc, cargo, etc).
- Open a terminal and go to this folder's location.
- Run *cargo run* in the terminal, this should download dependencies and run the program. Subsequent runs will be near instant.
- If you have problems running the program, please see [This extra list of needed dependencies that might not have been installed](https://bevyengine.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup/#installing-os-dependencies).
